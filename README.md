## React Employee Table

A sortable, filterable table created with React. For extra fun, this is a table of famous trans individuals color-coded with the trans pride flag.

# User Story

 As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
 
# Business Context 

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
    
# Installation
  `npm i react`
  
  `npm i react-table`
  
  `npm i styled-components`
  
  `npm start`
  
Then launch from localhost:3000 in the browser.
